## Lemhi Pass
We were at the western border of United States territory. We didn't see the Pacific ocean as we had hoped, we had saw the Rocky mountains.

## Salmon, ID
We arrived here on August 17, 1805. Sacagawea was born near here before being kidnapped by the Hidatsa tribe. She was able to convince her brother, the leader of the tribe, to give us horses and let us stay. Her brother also said that the Nez Perce knew of a big lake of salty water, so we knew that we were on the right trail.
