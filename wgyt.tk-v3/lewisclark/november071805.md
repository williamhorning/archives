## Fort Clatsop, OR
We had finally sighted the Pacific Ocean. We also built Fort Clatsop near the ocean and stayed here for a while. Now we knew that there was no direct way to access the Pacific Ocean from the Missouri River. We saw a lot of land,  and ocean. We also saw a whale in the Pacific. Clarkâ€™s measurement of the skeleton was 105 feet long. This was a huge whale.
