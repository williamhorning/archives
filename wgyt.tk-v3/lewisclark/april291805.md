## Confluence of The Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers
Today we were at the Confluence of The Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers. We were in the wilderness and it was full of hills, grass, buffalo, elk, antelopes, bighorn sheep and grizzly bear.  We also saw the confluence of the Missouri River and the Yellowstone River. We continued our journey on the Yellowstone River, going towards the Pacific Ocean.
