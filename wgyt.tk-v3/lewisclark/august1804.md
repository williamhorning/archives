## Fort Mandan
Today we built Fort Mandan, a fort close to Big Hidatsa Village. This fort had multiple living spaces and it took a while to build. We will be staying here until winter is over. 
## Big Hidatsa Village
After we had Built Fort Mandan, we went to Big Hidatsa Village, a village of 4,500 people. This was a lot more people compared to Washington DC. The village houses the Hidatsa and Mandan tribes. 20 families and their animals live in one big grass house. It appears to have lots of families and people living there.
