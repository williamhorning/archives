## Great Falls of the Missouri River

### June 14, 1805 (Lewis)

I had assigned my men jobs and I went to wander on my own. He didnâ€™t notice a grizzly had approached to within 20 paces of him. He ran towards the river until the bear ran away.

### June 16, 1805

Today we saw a lot of rattlesnakes, grizzlies, and mosquitoes. We also saw a breathtaking series of five waterfalls in modern-day Montana. We had to go around the falls on land while suffering through torrential rain, intense heat, rattlesnakes, grizzlies, and mosquitoes.
