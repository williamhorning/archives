## Lolo Pass
So far, this was the most dangerous and desperate part of our journey. We had to trekk over 200 miles of rough, snowy terrain. We also had to slaughter three colts just to survive.
## Weippe Prairie, ID
We stayed with the Nez Perce until mid-October. They directed us to the Clearwater River saying that it would carry us to the Pacific Ocean. The land here was flat and close to the Clearwater river. We saw salmon and Camas root.
