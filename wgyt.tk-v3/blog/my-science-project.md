My Science project about turtle's and earth's magnetic field. Did you know that Turtles use Earth’s magnetic field to find their way when migrating? Scientists have figured that out because National Geographic said “In 1996, a loggerhead turtle called Adelita swam across 9,000 miles from Mexico to Japan, crossing the entire Pacific on her way.” Adelita had no technology. She figured out her way because all turtles use magnetic fields to find their way. The turtles also use it to stay safe, because they can use magnetic fields to make sure that they stay in warmer areas. But these scientific studies were hard because they had to be careful with all of the turtles. Nathan Putman , the scientist behind these experiments says, “The loggerheads we use are a threatened species, so we have to be extra careful with all of them. We use newly hatched turtles for these studies, so we work with them and release them at night. We try to design really short experiments and house them for no more than a couple of hours before letting them go. It makes for rushed data collection!” This study shows that turtles can use magnetic fields to help them find their way.
