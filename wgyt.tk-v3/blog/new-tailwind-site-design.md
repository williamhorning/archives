## Original Post:
_I just made a new design for wgyt.tk in version 3 of wgyt.tk_ 
The new website design is now using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with some components from [Tailwind Components](https://tailwindcomponents.com/) along with some color tweaks. I also made a new blog framework that makes it easier to add more posts that uses markdown. 
***Only downside***: no comments :(
