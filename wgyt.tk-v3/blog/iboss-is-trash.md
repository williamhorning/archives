## Why is iBoss trash?
- IT BLOCKS ***EVERYTHING***
- IBOSS IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR CIPA COMPLIANCE
- IBOSS CAN BLOCK YOUTUBE VIDEOS THAT OUR TEACHERS ASSIGN
- IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY (JEFFALO SHOULD ADD THIS TO IS.WASTEOF.MONEY)
- IT BLOCKS COOLMATHGAMES
- IT USED TO BLOCK REPLIT ([SEE THIS BLOG POST](https://www.wgyt.tk/blog/repl.it-moves-to-replit.com))
- IT IS TRASH
- IT IS GARBAGE
- EVERYONE HATES IT
- NO ONE LIKES IT
- SOMETIMES IT BLOCKS YOUTUBE
- IT MAKES EVERYTHING SLOWER BECAUSE IT IS A PROXY
- IT PREVENTS STUDENTS FROM SAYING WHATEVER THEY WANT
