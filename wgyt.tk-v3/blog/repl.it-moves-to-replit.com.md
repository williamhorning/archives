## Original Post:
### Why do I not like this change?
- I can't use replit.com on my school pc because the school blocks replit.com but they don't block repl.it
- The URL is longer
- I will always think of replit as repl.it so the domain replit.com just feels wrong to me
### In depth essay:
#### school use
I use Replit at school to check if my website is down or to just code, but the new change makes this ***IMPOSSIBLE*** without using my phone to do that
#### the longer url
Not much of a problem unless repl.it doesn't forward to replit.com
#### branding and marketing lingo
Replit says in their [blog post](https://blog.replit.com/dotcom):
>One day after JSRepl had been up and running and my friends and I were using it, we were arguing about JavaScript semantics (as one does). Feeling frustrated by the inadequacy of the spoken word to prove programming ideas, I uttered, "just repl it!" And it was immediately apparent that we had to use that name, and "repl.it" had to be the domain. Haya then joined me to design the logo and website. Soon after, in addition to the console, we added an editor and that became the first departure from our pure REPL roots that will eventually become a full-featured code editor and programming environment.
Replit has grown so much since then, and while we have retained a big part of our REPL rootsâ€”interactivity, fast boot times, and reproducibilityâ€” we're now charting a new path and inventing the world's first completely portable and multiplayer programming environment & compute infrastructure where people learn how to code, build & ship apps, and even start and grow businesses.

This to me is just some marketing lingo and a rebranding, ishÂ®

@amasad (member of the replit team) commented on one of my repls (replitcom-proxy) asking what school I go to and talking about how he will try to help me.
## Edit #2:
@amasad got my school district to unblock replit!
